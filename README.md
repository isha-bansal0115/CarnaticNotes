# CarnaticNotes

## Inspiration
Inspiration comes form the fact that not many musicians in the us know that we can play indian music on our instruments and therefore donâ€™t try. this is the reason this website comes in handy and allow for musicians to embrace their culture through music

## What it does
The website basically acts as a converter from an unknown format to a known format. this way western musicians can play their favorite indian music using the convert and converted sheets

## How we built it
We have build a website using HTML and CSS. And then the functionality has been handled using javascript. 

## Challenges we ran into
We were not so familiar with the javascript so had to struggle with that part. Also for all of us this was our first hackathon so struggled with getting the idea and how to start 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we are able to help other musicians with the knowledge we have gained throughout this hackathon. we can now help others get closer to their indian heritage and understand their music culture

## What we learned

## What's next for Carnatic Notes
1. We can add the flats/sharp/natural part to the notes
2. let other users can post their recordings too
3. Look through design and see what could be changed
